lour: I really love to make my homemade pasta with “00” flour, which yields the silkiest pasta.  But if I am making a sauce that is a bit more hearty, I will use half “00” and half semolina flour, which makes the pasta a bit more sturdy and helps the sauce to cling to the pasta better.  That said, any of these three flours (or a combination of them) will work with this recipe:
“00” flour: My personal favorite, which makes the texture extra silky.
Semolina flour: A heartier flour, which can help the pasta cling better to the sauce.  (Semolina is also my favorite flour to sprinkle on the cutting board and pasta, while you are in the process of rolling out the dough.)
All-purpose flour: Also works pretty well if this is the only flour you have on hand.
Eggs: This recipe calls for four large eggs.
Olive oil: This will also help to moisten the dough.  (If the dough is still too dry, you can also add in a few teaspoons of water.)
Sea salt: We will add a teaspoon of fine sea salt to the recipe, plus I recommend adding a little extra to your pasta water when cooking the pasta.
HOMEMADE PASTA EQUIPMENT:
I’ve included instructions below for how to make homemade pasta completely by hand.  Or if you happen to own a food processor (my favorite method) or a stand mixer, those can save you some extra work too.

When it comes to actually rolling out the pasta, you can do so by hand (with a rolling pin and a knife).  Or you can additionally invest in a:

Pasta maker: I purchased the Atlas 150 pasta maker and really love and recommend it.  Or, if you happen to own a KitchenAid stand mixer, their pasta roller attachment works well too.
Pasta drying rack: Optional, but very helpful (and pretty!).  I opted for this wooden pasta drying rack and love it.

How To Make Pasta By Hand

Homemade Pasta In The Food Processor


Homemade Pasta Dough

HOW TO MAKE PASTA IN A FOOD PROCESSOR:
This is my preferred way to make homemade pasta because it’s the quickest and easiest!  Simply add all four ingredients to the bowl of a food processor (fitted with the normal blade attachment).  Pulse for about 10 seconds, or until the mixture reaches a crumbly texture (see above).  Remove the dough and pat it into a ball with your hands and place it on a lightly-floured cutting board.  Knead the dough for 1-2 minutes until it is smooth and elastic.  (If the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water.  If the dough seems wet or sticky, just add in some extra flour, but you the dough to be fairly dry.) Form the dough into a ball with your hands, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day.

HOW TO MAKE PASTA IN A STAND MIXER:
Also a super-simple method (especially convenient if you are also going to be using a stand mixer roller attachment to roll out the pasta dough).  Just combine all of your ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Then using the dough hook, mix and knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on low speed until it is smooth and elastic.  (If the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water.  If the dough seems wet or sticky, just add in some extra flour, but you the dough to be fairly dry.) Form the dough into a ball with your hands, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day.

HOW TO MAKE PASTA BY HAND:
If you don’t have a food processor or stand mixer, no prob!  Place the flour in a mound on a large cutting board.  Then use your fingers or a spoon to create a good-sized well in the middle of the flour mound (kind of like a volcano).  Add the eggs in the center of the well.  Sprinkle the salt and drizzle the olive oil on top of the eggs.  Use a fork to begin whisking the eggs.  Then once they are combined, begin gradually whisking some of the surrounding flour into the egg mixture, adding more and more until the egg mixture is nice and thick.  (If some eggs accidentally spill out, no worries, just use your hands or a bench scraper to pull them back in.)  Then use your hands to fold the rest of the dough all together until combined.  Knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic, sprinkling some extra flour on the cutting board if needed to prevent sticking or if the dough seems too wet or sticky.  (If the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water, but you want the dough to be fairly dry.)  Form the dough into a ball with your hands, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.  Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day.

How To Roll Pasta By Hand

Pasta Drying Rack

HOW TO ROLL FRESH PASTA WITH A PASTA MAKER:
Once the dough has rested for 30 minutes and is ready to go, remove it from the plastic wrap and transfer it again to a cutting board.  Use a knife to cut the dough into four equal wedges (like you’re slicing a pie), then set one wedge aside and immediately wrap the remaining three in the plastic wrap again to prevent them from drying out.

Sprinkle the cutting board (or a large baking sheet) generously with flour, and set aside.

Using your hands, shape the dough wedge into a oval-shaped flat disc.  Feed the dough through the pasta maker on the widest setting.  (On my pasta maker, this is setting number 1.)  Once the sheet comes out, fold it into thirds, similar to how you would fold a piece of paper to fit in an envelope.  Feed it through the rollers 2 or 3 more times, still on the widest setting.  Then continue to feed the dough through the rollers as you gradually reduce the settings, one pass at a time, until the pasta reaches your desired thickness.  (I like setting 6 on my pasta maker.)  Whenever the dough starts to get a bit sticky as you pass it through the rollers, just pause and drape the dough onto the floured cutting board to re-flour, being sure to coat both sides of the dough.  Also, if your dough sheet starts to get too long to handle, just cut it in half with a knife.

Once your dough sheet is ready to go, sprinkle it with flour once more.  Then connect the cutter attachment to your pasta maker (and transfer the handle to the cutter attachment, if need be).  Feed the sheet through the attachment to create your desired shape of pasta.  Then transfer the cut pasta to a drying rack, or swirl it into little pasta “nests” and lay them on a floured surface to dry for 30 minutes.  Repeat with the remaining pasta dough.

HOW TO ROLL FRESH PASTA WITH A STAND MIXER:
The process for the stand mixer is basically the same as using a traditional pasta maker.  (It’s just easier because you don’t have to use one hand to crank the machine!)  Simply connect the pasta roller attachment to your stand mixer.  Set the adjustment knob to the widest setting.  Then shape and feed the pasta dough into the roller as directed above until it reaches your desired thinness, lightly flouring the pasta as you go to prevent sticking.

Once your sheet of pasta is ready to go, sprinkle it with flour once more.  Then remove the roller attachment and connect the cutter attachment of your choice.  Feed the dough through the cutter.  Then transfer the cut pasta to a drying rack, or swirl it into little pasta “nests” and lay them on a floured surface to dry for 30 minutes.  Repeat with the remaining pasta dough.

HOW TO ROLL FRESH PASTA BY HAND:
To roll out your pasta by hand, shape one wedge into a oval-shaped flat disc, as directed above.  Transfer the disc to a cutting board, and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until it reaches your desired level of thickness (generally between 1-2 mm thick), adding extra flour to the cutting board as needed to prevent sticking. In general, a good test for thickness is that you should be able to see your hand through the dough if you carefully lift it up.

Using a pizza cutter or a knife, slice the dough into 5-inch sections.  Sprinkle each section with a bit of extra flour.  Then, starting on the short side of the sections, roll them up into very loose, flat cylinders (see above).  Cut the cylinders cross-wise to create your desired width of noodles.  Then transfer the cut pasta to a drying rack, or swirl it into little pasta “nests” and lay them on a floured surface to dry for 30 minutes.  Repeat with the remaining pasta dough.

HOW TO COOK FRESH PASTA:
To cook fresh pasta, bring a large stockpot of generously-salted water to a rolling boil over high heat.  Add in the fresh pasta, and then immediately begin to stir it gently so that the noodles do not stick together.  Continue to cook until the pasta is al dente.  (Keep a close eye on it — fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta!)  Then strain the fresh pasta and use immediately.

The cooking time for fresh pasta will depend entirely upon the thickness of the pasta, so be sure to check it regularly to see when it reaches the perfect al dente texture.  When I roll pasta to setting 6 on my pasta maker, it generally takes about 90 seconds to cook.

HOW TO STORE FRESH PASTA:
Be sure to let the pasta air out on a drying rack or on a baking sheet for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 hours).  Transfer to an airtight container and either refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 2 weeks.  To use frozen fresh pasta, transfer it to the refrigerator to thaw for at least 4-6 hours, then cook as usual.

Flour: As mentioned in the post above, I most often make homemade pasta with “00” flour, which yields the silkiest pasta.  But if I am making a sauce that is a bit more hearty, I will use half “00” and half semolina flour, which yields a pasta that is a bit more sturdy and also helps the sauce to cling to the pasta better.  That said, any of the three flour options listed above will work well.

I made this pasta with half semolina and half 00 to have with my homemade marinara. It was so easy to work with. This is only my second time making homemade pasta. The first recipe I used was a pain. This recipe was super easy and I used my kitchen aid start to finish! My husband said this is the best spaghetti and meatballs he ever ate. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

MARY — JANUARY 10, 2021 @ 12:48 PM
That’s funny, I had the opposite problem. I added only three eggs and it was still almost too wet. The age of flour and size of eggs a really can make a huge difference, though.

Very easy recipe which I make about once a week or every two. It is very good and I use 50% semolina and 00.

What would the suggestion be if I wanted to make a spinach noodle or other noodle with this recipe?

I made 2lbs of this for a family dinner; it turned out great and everyone loved it! 2lbs was enough for seven people, plus extra nests that I will freeze for later. I used a food processor to mix the ingredients together which was great, and hand-rolled the dough using a rolling pin. The pasta was a little thicker than I would have preferred, but I struggled a bit getting the pasta thin enough with just a rolling pin. Also, I used all-purpose flour which was what I had on hand. Overall, I’m happy with how it turned out being I had minimal equipment!

I used samolina wheat flour and the dough mixture never balled up. It was like a somewhat thicker liquid. 😢

TOMMY W — SEPTEMBER 29, 2020 @ 3:41 PM REPLY
I have made home made pasta many of times and have used different recipes but this is absolutely my favored recipe. I only use ‘00’ flour and refrigerate the wrapped dough overnight. When rolling out the pasta the next day I always sprinkle the counter top with semolina flour. This makes the process easier when rolling out the dough and makes the texture easy to process. Happy cooking and enjoy!

ANGELA — OCTOBER 10, 2020 @ 11:02 PM REPLY
Hi! Love your recipe – my second time using it and made amazing pasta :) I use half semola and half all purpose flour. Question for you – is it better to freeze the dough in ball or already rolled out into pasta to store?

I made the recipe exactly as-is in my food processor, only subbing four small duck eggs for the chicken eggs due to my chicken egg allergy. I was shocked when it came out of my food processor and the kneading process looking exactly like yours, supple and elastic and the loveliest golden yellow. The next step, after resting, of course, with the pasta roller was a mitigated success as it was my first time and I got weird shapes and tears, but the taste was fabulous. I have enough duck eggs left to make another batch, so I’m going to keep practicing!

This was a horrible recipe. Too much olive oil. Had to add at least 3/4 cup of flour to dry it out. Won’t be using this b one anymore.

ANDREW — NOVEMBER 2, 2020 @ 10:47 AM REPLY
Hi Ali – Wonderful recipe for fresh pasta! made 4 perfect portions. I used a mixture of flours; 1 cup semolina and 1 1/2 cup of Tipo 00. Because fresh pasta doesn’t need a lot of cooking time, it doesn’t give up much starch to the boiling water. If you’re using a sauce that relies on the integration of pasta water, you might want to cook that sauce for a longer period of time, to tighten it. But this recipe created a very smooth, easy to handle pasta dough. I rolled it and cut it by hand, and it was smooth and elastic. I didn’t dry it, and perhaps I will for the next batch. But thank you for this, I will make this again and again!

CHRIS MOODY — NOVEMBER 5, 2020 @ 9:41 AM REPLY
So easy to make using 00 Tipo flour which leaves your pasta silky smooth
A pasta maker isn’t a must but it makes the result much better due it producing a consistency you can’t get with a normal roller
Best recipe I’ve tried and I won’t need another

[1] … it takes a lot of scrolling to find the recipe.

[2] … semolina is an excellent addition; however, substituting “bread flour” instead of “0 0” is an excellent way to accomplish the same end, without semolina, which is hard to find.

[3] … all the VooDoo about food processors, crumbs, pulsing, is unnecessary. Just put the flour and salt in the bowl, squirt in a healthy amount of olive oil, then the 4 cracked eggs. Turn it on, and let it blend for about 15 seconds. Done.

[4] … the REAL test is how the crumbs hold together. If pressed between fingers and they want to fall apart again, then you need a couple of tablespoons of water. If however, they are gummy, then a quarter-cup of additional flour. REBLEND right in the food processor bowl. 5 more seconds. TEST AGAIN. Adjust if you need to. You ought not to need to.

[5] … once they stick together, then dump onto a kneading board. Knead for 30 seconds to 2 minutes … until a reasonably compact ball that doesn’t have bits falling off forms.

THE REST is just as per your article.

From the ‘bags and boxes’ of flour, eggs, and so on, to a ball of dough is less than 5 minutes, typically.

Thank you for this recipe. I make this homemade pasta recipe at least once a week now and it is so easy to alter for laminated pastas and alternative flour pastas. I do have to change the amount of flour I use depending on the humidity of my house and the brand of the flour but otherwise this is a beautiful base recipe for egg pasta.

It was my first time making pasta with my new stand mixer and the final results were perfect! A little thick but unsure if it was the mixture of 00 and all purpose flour or I didn’t run it through the rolling attachment enough times. Trying with a different combination of flour today – let’s see how it goes. Can’t wait to try some sauce recipes too!

IDA MARX — DECEMBER 26, 2020 @ 4:21 PM REPLY
Love this recipe. It was simple and my pasta came out perfectly. I used 2 1/4 cup all purpose flour, and 1/4 cup semolina flour. I did all the kneading by hand, which is why I used a low ratio of semolina, as it becomes too difficult to knead otherwise. The only thing I changed was I added about twice the amount of olive oil, as it needed more for elasticity. The pasta was so sturdy that it handled beautifully, and had a wonderful texture. I will use this recipe again!

I have made so many of Ali’s recipes and they are always a huge hit! Tried making this pasta recipe in my stand mixer and the dough was super dry. I used semolina flour as I always do when I make it by hand. I needed to add 1/3 cup of water to get the right consistency. I’m wondering if I missed something?

RACHAEL THAIN — DECEMBER 31, 2020 @ 3:50 PM REPLY
My go to pasta recipe – super easy and delicious! I’ve made it by hand and also used the kitchen aid mixer and both were worked so well. I used half 00 and half all purpose flour and I loved the combo. Biggest tip is to weigh your flour! You’d be shocked how off your scoops of flour can be to how much you actually need.

I have been on a mission to find the best pasta recipe, and I honestly think I found it. This is truly a test kitchen pasta recipe. I love the flexibility in the flours and methods offered here. The ratio of eggs to flour is great. I didn’t end up with a sticky mess or a dough that wouldn’t come together. I tried it in the food processor and it was so easy!

I used half semolina and half AP flour. I made a simple spaghetti and I served it with Marcella Hazan’s Tomato Sauce, which is our favorite. The semolina flour gave it great texture and it held onto the sauce really well.

For those who are struggling with the dough, really pay attention to her tips and the photos. The dough should be dry, not super sticky. If it’s too wet, it will be a pain to work with when you’re rolling it out and cutting, and the noodles will stick together. Egg size matters, so if you’ve got three that are basically the same size and one random giant one, you’ll probably have to add an extra tablespoon or two of flour. All of the advice in this recipe is spot on.

This is a solid recipe, and I see much more fresh pasta in our future. Next time I’m breaking out the ravioli molds!

I’ve been trying different pasta recipes for the last year and with this one the search is over. I ended up kneading it by hand because the stand mixer was so ineffective but that was a small price to pay. I ended up using 1.5 cups semolina and 1 cup 00 flour and the texture was perfect. Thank you!
